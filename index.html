        <h2>Birth and Childhood Of Sri Ramakrishna</h2>
        <img src="041-sri-ramakrishna-saw-jesus.jpg" width=200px height=120px align="right" border="2px solid black"><p>Sri Ramakrishna was born on 18 February 1836 in the village of Kamarpukur about sixty miles northwest of Kolkata.
           His parents, Kshudiram Chattopadhyaya and Chandramani Devi, were poor but very pious and virtuous. 
           As a child, Ramakrishna (his childhood name was Gadadhar) was dearly loved by the villagers.
           From early days, he had strong disinclination towards formal education and worldly affairs. 
           He was, however, a talented boy, and could sing and paint well. He was fond of serving holy men and listening to their discourses.
           He was oftentimes found to be absorbed in spiritual moods. At the age of six, he experienced the first ecstasy while watching a flight of white cranes moving against the background of black clouds.
           This tendency to enter into ecstasy intensified with age. His father’s death when he was seven years old served only to deepen his introspection and increase his detachment from the world.</p>

        <h2>Life at Dakhineshwar</h2>
        <img src="1280px-Kolkatatemple.jpg" width=500px height=230px border="2px solid black" align="right"><p>In 1855 Ramakrishna was appointed as the priest of Dakshineswar Kali Temple, 
          built by Rani Rashmoni—a wealthy female zamindar of Kolkata who was well known for her kindness and benevolence to the poor and 
          also for her religious devotion, she belonged to the kaivarta community. Ramakrishna, along with his nephew Hriday, became assistants to Ramkumar, with Ramakrishna given the task of decorating the deity. 
          When Ramkumar died in 1856, Ramakrishna took his place as the priest of the Kali temple
          After Ramkumar's death Ramakrishna became more contemplative. He began to look upon the image of the goddess Kali as his mother and the mother of the universe, and became desperate for a vision of her.
          After many days of meditation, wherein he failed to receive a vision, he reportedly came to a point of such anguish that he impulsively decided to end his life. Seeing a sword hanging in a nearby room in the temple, he ran for it and was just about to reach it when he suddenly
          had a vision of the goddess Kali as the Universal Mother. He became overwhelmed, and before fainting, observed that to his
          spiritual sight, "... houses, doors, temples and everything else vanished altogether; as if there was nothing anywhere! 
          And what I saw was an infinite shoreless sea of light; a sea that was consciousness. However far and in whatever direction I looked, I saw shining waves, one after another, coming towards me.</p>

        <h2>Profound Spiritual Practices</h2>
        <img src="Ramakrishna.jpg" width=300px height=220px border="2px solid black" align="right"><p>Sri Ramakrishna’s God-intoxicated state alarmed his relatives in Kamarpukur and they got him married to Sarada, a girl from the neighbouring village of Jayrambati.
           Unaffected by the marriage, Sri Ramakrishna plunged into even more intense spiritual practices.
           Impelled by a strong inner urge to experience the different aspects of God he followed, with the help of a series of Gurus, 
           the various paths described in the Hindu scriptures, and realized God through each of them. The first teacher to appear at Dakshineswar (in 1861) was a remarkable woman known as Bhairavi Brahmani who was an advanced spiritual adept, well versed in scriptures.
           With her help Sri Ramakrishna practised various difficult disciplines of the Tantrik path, and attained success in all of them. Three years later came a wandering monk by name Totapuri, under whose guidance Sri Ramakrishna attained Nirvikalpa Samadhi, the highest spiritual 
           experience mentioned in the Hindu scriptures. He remained in that state of non-dual existence for six months without the least awareness of even his own body. In this way, 
           Sri Ramakrishna relived the entire range of spiritual experiences of more than three thousand years of Hindu religion.

        <h2>Worshipping SRI MAA SARADA DEVI</h2>
        <img src="Holy_mother_sarada.jpg" width=250px height=250px border="2px solid black" align="left"><p>In 1872, his wife Sarada, nineteen years old, came from the village to meet him. He received her cordially, 
          and taught her how to attend to household duties and at the same time lead an intensely spiritual life. 
          Sri Ramakrishna looked upon Sarada Devi as a special manifestation of Divine Mother of the universe. In 1872, on the night of the Phala-harini-Kali-puja, he ritualistically worshipped Sarada Devi as the Divine Mother, thereby awakening universal Motherhood latent in her. When disciples began to gather around Sri Ramakrishna, Sarada Devi learned to look upon them as her own children. The room in which she stayed at Dakshineshwar was too small to live in and had hardly any amenities; and on many days she did not get the opportunity of meeting Sri Ramakrishna.
          But she bore all difficulties silently and lived in contentment and peace, serving the increasing number of devotees who came to see Sri Ramakrishna. 
          Although Sarada continued to stay with him, they lived immaculately pure lives, and their marital relationship was purely spiritual.
          It should be mentioned here that Sri Ramakrishna had been ordained a Sannyasin (Hindu monk), and he observed the basic vows of a monk to perfection. 
          But outwardly he lived like a lay man, humble, loving and with childlike simplicity. During Sri Ramakrishna’s stay at Dakshineswar, 
          Rani Rasmani first acted as his patron. After her death, her son-in-law Mathur Nath Biswas took care of his needs.</p>

        <h2>Love For Devotess and Swamiji's Role in his Life</h2>
        <img src="swami-vivekananda-sadananda.jpg" width=300px height=250px border="2px slid black" align="right"><p>
          As bees swarm around a fully blossomed flower, devotees now started coming to Sri Ramakrishna. He divided them into two categories. The first one consisted of householders. He taught them how to realize God while living in the world and discharging their family duties. The other more important category was a band of educated youths, mostly from the middle class families of Bengal, whom he trained to become monks and to be the torchbearers of his message to mankind. The foremost among them was Narendranath, who years later, as Swami Vivekananda, 
          carried the universal message of Vedanta to different parts of the world, revitalized Hinduism, and awakened the soul of India. Among the Europeans who were influenced by Ramakrishna was Principal Dr. William Hastie of the Scottish Church College, Kolkata.
          In the course of explaining the word trance in the poem The Excursion by William Wordsworth, Hastie told his students that if they wanted to know its "real meaning", they should go to "Ramakrishna of Dakshineswar." This prompted some of his students, including Narendranath Dutta (later Swami Vivekananda), to visit Ramakrishna.Despite initial reservations, Vivekananda became Ramakrishna's most influential follower, popularizing a modern interpretation of Indian traditions which harmonised Tantra, Yoga and Advaita Vedanta. Vivekananda established the Ramakrishna order, which eventually spread its mission posts throughout the world. Monastic disciples, who renounced their family and became the earliest monks of the Ramakrishna order, included Rakhal Chandra Ghosh (Swami Brahmananda), 
          Kaliprasad Chandra (Swami Abhedananda), Taraknath Ghoshal (Swami Shivananda), Sashibhushan Chakravarty (Swami Ramakrishnananda), 
          Saratchandra Chakravarty (Swami Saradananda), Tulasi Charan Dutta (Swami Nirmalananda), Gangadhar Ghatak (Swami Akhandananda), Hari Prasana (Swami Vijnanananda) Swami Turiyananda and others.</p>

        <h2>Last Days</h2>
        <img src="rama.jpg" width=250px height=250px border="2px slid black" align="right"><p>In the beginning of 1885 Ramakrishna suffered from clergyman's throat, which gradually developed into throat cancer. He was moved to Shyampukur near Kolkata, where some of the best physicians of the time, including Dr. Mahendralal Sarkar, were engaged. When his condition aggravated he was relocated to a large garden house at Cossipore on 11 December 1885. 
          During his last days, he was looked after by his monastic disciples and Sarada Devi. Ramakrishna was advised by the doctors to keep the strictest silence, but ignoring their advice, he incessantly conversed with visitors. According to traditional accounts, before his death, Ramakrishna transferred his spiritual powers to Vivekananda and reassured Vivekananda of his avataric status. Ramakrishna asked Vivekananda to look after the welfare of the disciples, saying, "keep my boys together" and asked him to "teach them". Ramakrishna also asked other monastic disciples to look upon Vivekananda as their leader. 
          Ramakrishna's condition gradually worsened, and he died in the early morning hours of 16 August 1886 at the Cossipore garden house. According to his disciples, this was mahasamadhi. After the death of their master, the monastic disciples led by Vivekananda formed a fellowship at a half-ruined house at Baranagar near the river Ganges, with the financial assistance of the householder disciples. This became the first Math or monastery of the disciples who constituted the first Ramakrishna Order.</p>

        <h2>Great Words of Sri Ramakrishna</h2>
        <img src="freepressjournal_import_2018_08_gallery-ramakrishna-sitting-500px.jpg" width=250px height=350px align="right" border="2px solid black">
        <p>The message of Sri Ramakrishna to the modern world, which he gave through his life and through his recorded conversations, may be briefly stated as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>"The <mark>goal of human life</mark> is the realization of the Ultimate Reality which alone can give man supreme fulfilment and everlasting peace. This is the essence of all religions."</li>
          <br>
          <li>"The <mark>Ultimate Reality</mark> is one; but it is personal as well as impersonal, and is indicated by different names (such as God, Ishvar, etc) in different religions."</li>
          <br>
          <li>"<mark>Purity of mind</mark> is an essential condition for the attainment of the Ultimate Reality; real purity is freedom from lust and greed. External observances are only of secondary importance."</li> 
          <br>
          <li><mark>God realization</mark> is possible for all. The householders need not renounce the world; but they should pray sincerely, practise discrimination between the Eternal and the temporal and remain unattached. God listens to sincere prayer. Intense longing (vyakulata) is the secret of success in spiritual life.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Since God dwells in all people, helping the needy should be done not out of compassion (which is an attitude of condescension) but as <mark>humble service to God</mark>.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Life is an expression of the spontaneous creativity (Lila) of God. Pleasure and pain, success and failure, etc are to be borne with patience, and <mark>one should resign oneself to God’s will</mark> under all circumstances.</li>

        <h2>Contributions of Sri Ramakrishna to World Culture</h2>
        <label>Spiritual Ideal</label>
        <p>One of the important contributions of Sri Ramakrishna is the reestablishment of the ideal of God realization in the modern world. In a world in which people’s faith in traditional religions has been considerably reduced by the relentless attack of the forces of atheism, materialism and scientific thinking, Sri Ramakrishna established the possibility of having direct experience of transcendent Reality. His life has enabled thousands of people to gain or regain faith in God and in the eternal verities of religion. As Mahatma Gandhi has stated: “His (Ramakrishna’s) life enables us to see God face to face. 
          No one can read the story of his life without being convinced that God alone is real and that all else is an illusion.”</p>
        <label>Harmony of Religions</label>
        <p>Sri Ramakrishna, however, is more well known all over the world as the Prophet of Harmony of Religions. He did not say that all the religions are the same. He recognized differences among religions but showed that, in spite of these differences, all religions lead to the same ultimate goal, and hence they are all valid and true. This view is nowadays known as “Pluralism”: Sri Ramakrishna is its primary originator. The uniqueness of Sri Ramakrishna’s view is that it was based, not on speculation, but on direct experience gained through actual practice. Since conflicts among religions and the rise of religious fundamentalism are a major threat to the peace, prosperity and progress of humanity, Sri Ramakrishna’s doctrine of harmony of religions has immense importance in the modern world. Regarding this, the distinguished British historian Arnold Toynbee has written: “… Mahatma Gandhi’s principle of non-violence and Sri Ramakrishna’s testimony to the harmony of religions:
           here we have the attitude and the spirit that can make it possible for the human race to grow together into a single family – and in the Atomic Age, this is the only alternative to destroying ourselves.”</p>
        <label>Boost to Moral Life</label>
        <p>Sri Ramakrishna’s emphasis on truthfulness and renunciation of lust and greed has given a great boost to moral life in modern times. 
           He also cleansed religious life of immoral practices, external pomp, miracle mongering, etc.</p>
        <label>Divinization Of Love</label>
        <p>Sri Ramakrishna elevated love from the level of emotions to the level of the unity of all Selves in God. Although the principle of oneness of the Supreme Self and its immanence in all beings is a central point in the Upanishads, it was seldom applied in practical life. Sri Ramakrishna saw the Divine in his wife, in his disciples, in others, even in fallen women, and treated them all with respect. The famous dictum of the New Testament, “God is Love”, found its verification in Sri Ramakrishna. Divinization of love 
          and human relationships is another contribution of Sri Ramakrishna which has immense significance for the welfare of humanity.</p>

          <li>Pure knowledge and pure love are one and the same thing. Both lead the aspirants to the same goal. The path of love is much easier.</li>
